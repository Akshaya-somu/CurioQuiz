## 📘 Project Overview

CurioQuiz aims to automate the generation of multiple-choice questions based on user-provided text inputs. This is particularly useful for educators and students to create quizzes for study or evaluation purposes quickly. The system supports user registration and login to personalize quiz data and tracks quiz history, allowing users to review past attempts.

The backend leverages Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, combined with NLP libraries like **spaCy** to parse and extract meaningful information from the text. The frontend uses **Bootstrap** and **JavaScript** to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.
